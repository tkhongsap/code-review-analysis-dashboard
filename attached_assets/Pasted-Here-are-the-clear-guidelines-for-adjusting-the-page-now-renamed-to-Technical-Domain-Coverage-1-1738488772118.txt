Here are the clear guidelines for adjusting the page, now renamed to Technical Domain Coverage:

1. **Page Title & Description**
- Change "Work Area Analysis" to "Technical Domain Coverage"
- Add description subtitle: "Distribution of support requests by technical domains and their related areas of expertise"
- Font: Title (text-2xl/24px), Subtitle (text-gray-600)

2. **Card Layout Changes**
- Use 3-column grid layout with consistent spacing (gap-6)
- Each card should have same height and padding (p-6)
- Add subtle border (border-gray-100) and shadow-sm
- Hover effect: slightly larger shadow (shadow-md)

3. **Card Content Structure**
- Header section with:
  * Domain icon on left (e.g., AlertCircle icon for Error Handling)
  * Domain name (font-medium)
  * Percentage badge on right (rounded-full, blue gradient)
- Divider line below header (border-b border-gray-100 my-4)
- "Related Domains:" label (replacing "Broader Work Areas:")
- Related domains as interactive pills:
  * Light gray background (bg-gray-50)
  * Rounded corners (rounded-md)
  * Subtle hover effect (hover:bg-gray-100)
  * Consistent padding (px-3 py-2)

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Domain icons: should be the same as those in Category Analysis
- Domain names: Slightly larger than related domains
- Percentage badges: Prominent but not overwhelming
- Related domains: Slightly smaller text (text-sm)

5. **Color Scheme**
- Percentage badges: blue gradient (from-blue-500 to-blue-600)
- Cards: White background with subtle borders
- Domain pills: Light gray with hover states

6. **Responsive Behavior**
- Desktop: 3 columns
- Tablet: 2 columns
- Mobile: 1 column
- Maintain consistent spacing across breakpoints

7. **Interactive Elements**
- Add hover states to all interactive elements
- Consider adding click behavior to expand/collapse related domains
- Ensure all interactive elements have proper cursor indicators

This should create a clean, professional look that maintains consistency with the rest of the dashboard while clearly presenting the technical domain distribution data.

The key changes from the previous version are:
- "Work Area" → "Technical Domain"
- "Broader Work Areas" → "Related Domains"
- Updated description to better reflect the technical nature of the categorization
- Maintained all the visual consistency while updating the terminology
